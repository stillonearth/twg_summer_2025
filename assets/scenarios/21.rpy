    mi "I can't... I can't do this anymore."

    mi "Everything is too much. The noise, the pressure, the expectations."

    mi "Even the silence is screaming at me."

    mi "My chest feels like it's collapsing in on itself."

    mi "When did breathing become so difficult?"

    mi "All the walls I've built to keep the world out are crumbling."

    mi "And I'm buried underneath the rubble."

    mi "Every small problem feels like a mountain I can't climb."

    mi "Every thought spirals into ten more anxious thoughts."

    mi "I'm drowning in my own mind."

    mi "Why is existing so impossibly hard?"

    mi "I used to be able to handle things. When did I become so fragile?"

    mi "The tears won't stop. I don't even know what started them."

    mi "Everything hurts. My head, my heart, my soul."

    mi "I'm so tired of pretending I'm okay when I'm clearly not."

    mi "Maybe if I just... disappear for a while..."

    hide mi

    "Mi crumbles completely, overwhelmed by the weight of everything."

    "Sobs rack her body as years of suppressed emotion pour out."

    "The room feels like it's closing in, reality becoming too intense to bear."

    "This is what happens when you hold everything inside for too long."

    "Eventually, something has to break - and today, it's her."

    "In this moment of complete vulnerability, healing might finally be able to begin."

    "But first, she needs to fall apart completely."
