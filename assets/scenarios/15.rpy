    mi "Just one more level. That's what I said twelve hours ago."

    mi "The energy drink cans are stacked like monuments to my dedication."

    mi "Or maybe monuments to my complete lack of self-control."

    mi "The screen has become my entire universe, burning into my retinas."

    mi "Day turned to night without me noticing. Time is just a concept here."

    mi "My character has gained seventeen levels since I started."

    mi "If only real life had experience points this clear."

    mi "My eyes are dry and bloodshot, but I can't stop now."

    mi "I'm so close to unlocking that legendary weapon."

    mi "My back aches from hunching over the controller for hours."

    mi "But physical discomfort is nothing compared to the rush of progression."

    mi "The outside world could be ending and I wouldn't know."

    mi "Or care, honestly. This digital realm makes more sense."

    mi "Clear objectives, immediate rewards, no messy human complications."

    mi "I've forgotten to eat. Again. The hunger pangs are just background noise now."

    mi "My guild is counting on me for the midnight raid."

    mi "At least someone needs me, even if they don't know my real name."

    hide mi

    "Mi's eyes remain glued to the screen as hours continue to blur together."

    "The cycle of day and night through the window becomes irrelevant."

    "Empty food containers and energy drink cans accumulate around her chair."

    "In this marathon session, the boundary between player and character dissolves."

    "Reality becomes the thing that happens between respawn timers."
