    mi "I actually woke up before noon. And I feel... rested?"

    mi "When did that last happen? It feels like a small miracle."

    mi "The morning sunlight doesn't feel accusatory today - it feels welcoming."

    mi "Time to do this right. Real breakfast, not just coffee and regret."

    mi "I'm making eggs, toast, even cutting up fresh fruit like a functional adult."

    mi "Brushed my teeth without arguing with myself about it first."

    mi "Washed my face with actual face wash instead of just splashing water."

    mi "Look at me, following a routine like I'm someone who has their life together."

    mi "Maybe I do, just for today. Maybe that's enough."

    mi "The kitchen is clean, my bed is made, and I'm dressed in actual clothes."

    mi "Not pajamas, not yesterday's outfit - fresh, clean clothes that make me feel human."

    mi "I even did some light stretching. My body feels grateful for the movement."

    mi "This is what people mean when they talk about 'good habits,' isn't it?"

    mi "Each small action building on the last one, creating momentum."

    mi "I feel capable today. Like I could actually accomplish things."

    mi "Maybe even leave the apartment later. The thought doesn't fill me with dread."

    mi "This is what hope feels like in action."

    hide mi

    "Mi moves through her morning routine with purpose and energy."

    "Each completed task adds to her growing sense of capability."

    "The bright morning light illuminates a person who looks ready to face the day."

    "Perfect mornings are rare, but they prove that good days are possible."

    "Sometimes all you need is one successful morning to remember who you can be."
