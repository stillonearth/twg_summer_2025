    mi "Phone on silent. Notifications turned off. Social media logged out."

    mi "Every possible avenue of contact has been deliberately severed."

    mi "The world wants too much from me today."

    mi "Responses, reactions, the energy to pretend I'm functioning."

    mi "But I have nothing left to give anyone, including myself."

    mi "Each buzz of the phone feels like a demand I can't meet."

    mi "So today, I choose to disappear from everyone's radar."

    mi "Let them wonder where I went. Let them assume I'm busy."

    mi "It's better than admitting I'm drowning in my own life."

    mi "The silence is both protective and isolating."

    mi "No one can hurt me if I don't let them reach me."

    mi "But no one can help me either."

    mi "Maybe that's for the best. I'm tired of being a burden."

    mi "Tired of conversations that require me to be someone I'm not."

    mi "In this self-imposed silence, I don't have to perform normalcy."

    mi "I can just exist in whatever broken state I'm in."

    mi "Tomorrow I'll probably regret this. But today, this is survival."

    hide mi

    "Mi systematically shuts down every form of communication."

    "The digital world continues its chatter without her participation."

    "In the growing silence, she finds both peace and deeper isolation."

    "Sometimes protection and self-harm look identical from the inside."

    "The world keeps spinning, but she's chosen to step off for today."
