    show mi

    mi "This is it. I can't go any lower than this."

    mi "I'm sitting in the wreckage of what used to be my life."

    mi "Everything I've avoided, everything I've ignored - it's all caught up with me."

    mi "But strangely... I feel calm for the first time in months."

    mi "Maybe because there's nowhere left to fall."

    mi "Rock bottom has a weird kind of stability to it."

    mi "All the pretending, all the denial - it's over now."

    mi "I can finally see myself clearly in this darkness."

    mi "And you know what? I'm still here. I'm still breathing."

    mi "I've survived every terrible day so far, haven't I?"

    mi "Maybe... maybe this isn't the end. Maybe it's the beginning."

    mi "The only way out is through, and I've been running sideways for too long."

    mi "I can stay here in this pit, or I can start climbing."

    mi "It won't be easy. It might be the hardest thing I've ever done."

    mi "But for the first time in forever, I want to try."

    mi "Not because I have to, but because I deserve better than this."

    mi "The light breaking through feels like hope, and I'd forgotten what that felt like."

    hide mi

    "In the depths of her lowest moment, Mi finds something unexpected - clarity."

    "Rock bottom becomes not an ending, but a foundation to build from."

    "The darkness that seemed infinite now has cracks where light seeps through."

    "Sometimes you have to lose everything to realize what's worth fighting for."

    "Today, Mi chooses to fight for herself, perhaps for the first time in years."

    "The journey back won't be easy, but it starts with this single moment of hope."
