    mi "Finally, something I can actually control."

    mi "The controller feels natural in my hands, like an extension of myself."

    mi "In this digital world, I have power, purpose, objectives to complete."

    mi "The vibrant colors on screen are so much brighter than real life."

    mi "Here, I can be a hero, an explorer, someone who matters."

    mi "Every level cleared is a small victory I can actually achieve."

    mi "Unlike real life, where progress feels impossible to measure."

    mi "The music is upbeat and encouraging, designed to make me feel capable."

    mi "My character jumps, runs, fights with perfect precision."

    mi "If only I had this much coordination in the real world."

    mi "But for now, this world is enough."

    mi "No bills to pay, no social expectations, no complex human emotions."

    mi "Just clear goals and immediate feedback."

    mi "Win or lose, there's always another life, another chance to try again."

    mi "The hours slip by without notice when I'm in the zone like this."

    mi "This is where I feel most like myself."

    mi "Or maybe most like who I wish I could be."

    "In this space, failure is just practice, and every restart is a new opportunity."

    "For a few hours, she feels competent, engaged, and genuinely happy."
