    mi "Sometimes you need to go back to the basics."

    mi "The old console boots up with that familiar chime that takes me back."

    mi "Pixelated graphics that somehow feel more real than today's photorealistic games."

    mi "These 8-bit characters don't need complex backstories or emotional depth."

    mi "They just jump, run, and collect coins. Simple goals for simpler times."

    mi "I remember being a kid, playing this exact same level."

    mi "Back when my biggest worry was whether I'd have enough quarters for the arcade."

    mi "The music is so cheerfully repetitive, burrowing into your brain like a happy virus."

    mi "Every beep and bloop is pure nostalgia made sound."

    mi "These games don't judge you for your life choices."

    mi "They don't care that you're playing them at 3 PM on a Tuesday."

    mi "In a world of endless complexity, there's comfort in games that fit on a single screen."

    mi "No massive open worlds to explore, no skill trees to optimize."

    mi "Just pure, distilled fun from a time when games didn't try to be everything."

    mi "Maybe this is what happiness feels like - uncomplicated joy."

    mi "Like being wrapped in a warm blanket made of childhood memories."

    hide mi

    "Mi loses herself in the familiar rhythms of classic gameplay."

    "Each level is like visiting an old friend who never changed."

    "The pixelated worlds feel more welcoming than the real one."

    "In these simple games, progress is measured in points and lives, not years and regrets."

    "For a while, she's not a hikikomori - she's just a kid playing games."
